## How To Use These Exercises

1. Make your edits in the `index.html` and/or the `style.css` files in order to make the output in your browser look like the Desired Outcome image(s).
    - Depending on the instructions of the exercise, you may only need to make edits in one of these files.
1. Once you successfully finish an exercise, check TOP's example solution.
    - You should not be checking the solution for an exercise until you finish it!
    - If your solution differs from TOP's solution (and still passes the exercise's requirements), that is completely fine. The provided solution is only an example and there are always multiple approaches. Feel free to ask in our Discord if there are parts of the example solution you do not understand.

> Do not submit your solutions to this repo, as any PRs that do so will be closed without merging.

## Some Hints
- The provided example solutions put all changes at the _end_ of the CSS file, which may duplicate some selectors (e.g. there might be a `body {}` in the given CSS and another `body {}` in the solution). When you are working on an exercise, it is best practice to add your CSS to existing selectors instead of duplicating them at the end of the file. We're sacrificing this best practice in our official solutions to make it extra clear to you what things we changed to solve the exercise.
- Unless listed in the self-check section, do not worry about getting the exact pixel value for things like margin, padding and font size. These exercises are intended to test your knowledge of CSS, not your ability to guess that a screenshot is using `font: sans-serif bold 16px` or that the margin is _exactly_ `42px`.
- You may need to add some elements to your HTML to get things into the right spot. (For the first few exercises, we make it explicit when this needs to happen.)
- You may need to add more selectors to your CSS file. The first few exercises have almost everything already done for you, but as you progress, you'll find that you need to add more and more selectors to get the correct result.
